# Linux installation

Any linux distro should work. However, we recommend running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, since all scripts
and installations are developed on that distro, so is guaranteed to work. Using other distros may result in more work,
but should always work.


## My machine is Windows with 8GB+ of memory

In this case, we recommend running Linux as a virtual machine, using either VirutalBox (free) or VMWare.

Download VirtualBox here:

Ubuntu VM images can be downloaded here:

 https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/


Create a new user with administrator privileges, and delete the old one.

## My machine is Mac or Windows with 4GB or less of memory

### Dual boot option

Find a dual boot manager that is compatible with your hardware, find instructions for
it. This option is not officially supported by teachers, although we will help if asked.


__Less than 4Gb?__ Starting the course on such a small machine is risky, you might get away
with it, but we definitely recommend 8Gb or more.
