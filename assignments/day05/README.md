# Week 1 - Assignment

**Turn in your GitHub repository URL into Canvas solo or in pairs (if the Github
repository is private please add kthorri and ironpeak as
collaborators)**

You should store all the source files in your repository:

```bash
├── itemrepository
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── database.js
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── package.json
├── assignments
│   ├── day01
│   │   └── answers.md
│   └── day02
│       └── answers.md
├── scripts
│   ├── initialize_game_api_instance.sh
│   ├── verify_environment.sh
│   └── deploy.sh
├── docker-compose.yml
├── infrastructure.tf
└── README.md
```

They must be placed at these location to get full marks.

Add a `README.md` file, it should include the URL to the instance running 
the API and make sure the port 3000 is reachable from anywhere so we can 
verify that the API is running. Along with any additional information 
about the project that you want us to take into account when grading.
